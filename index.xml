      <description>distracting yourself by listening to car radio I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire Exhale desire I know it&amp;#39;s dire My time today I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought &amp;#39;Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence he distracted himself by listening to his car radio, but someone stole it we distract ourselves from our meaningless by clinging to some idea, some person, some materialistic thing some became nihilist, some became hedonist, some became slave, some accept religion dealing with existential crisis Sometimes quiet is violent I find it hard to hide it My pride is no longer inside It&amp;#39;s on my sleeve My skin will scream Reminding me of Who I killed inside my dream I hate this car that I&amp;#39;m driving There&amp;#39;s no hiding for me I&amp;#39;m forced to deal with what I feel There is no distraction to mask what is real I could pull the steering wheel he got to know that his pride is not inside him but in how he is perceived by others he now know that he had killed himself in his dreams, just to fit in and now their is no car radio to distract him from this guilt he is fed up to the point that he even thought of killing himself (pulling the steering wheel) it is a frightening thought I ponder of something terrifying &amp;#39;Cause this time there&amp;#39;s no sound to hide behind I find over the course of our human existence One thing consists of consistence And it&amp;#39;s that we&amp;#39;re all battling fear Oh dear, I don&amp;#39;t know if we know why we&amp;#39;re here Oh my, Too deep Please stop thinking I liked it better when my car had sound this feeling, this thought is so frightening for him and he can&amp;rsquo;t suppress these only thing that is consistent in everybody&amp;rsquo;s life is that they are constantly battling with their suffering and fear He wants to stop thinking about this, and just be normal but ironically, normal is defined by others, and if you dont fit in their template of normal then you are not accepted as normal He wants to be normal and live in a delusional reality, or does he !</description>

      <description>Nihilism I know that there is no objective meaning outside the illusions we (humans) as a society created. Existentialism As humans, we have freedom to create our own meaning to live. Essence make something what it is a defined purpose a meaning to life an essence, necessary for anything to exist Absurdism Constant tension between the hunger for meaning and impossibility of satisfying this drive in a meaningless world. Stare in this meaninglessness and show middle finger.</description>
