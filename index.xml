      <description>Indexes What a data structure, can make some queries fast Why cause, without index every query will be a sequential scan from disk whole point of index is to make query faster than O(n) so why not create an index for each type of query, cause indexes makes updating slow as we have to update indexes it also increases disk usage, slows down backup and restore Single Column Index index made on a single attribute Multi Column Index index made on a group of attribute Partial Index index made on a subset of table ex: index on all the incomplete appointments in appointments table B+ Tree Index uses B+ Tree for creating indexes default in postgresql stores pointer to heap file and not actual data better to store actual data for primary index as reading from heap file is another disk i/o used for query with operations like &amp;lt;, &amp;lt;= , = ,&amp;gt;=,&amp;gt; can be used for range queries, first go to the start of range in O(log(n)) and then traverse to next node can be used for patterns like ^foo or foo% (constant prefix) but not with %foo as BTree are sorted based on first char not suitable for large values of key as btree copies the key value in nodes -&amp;gt; less keys per node -&amp;gt; tree with more depth Hash Index uses hash table instead of btree PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the hash code (about 4 billion possible hash codes) hashfunction(index attribute) -&amp;gt; bucket which contains pointer to the rows -&amp;gt; actual data in table can be smaller in size than btree Hash index select and insert performance can be better than a B-Tree index suitable for update heavy queries which uses equality operator should be used with equality operator and not with comparative operators, example select * from table where key = &#39;hello&#39; suitable for large values as their too are converted to 32 bit int values BRIN Index Block range index A block range is a group of pages that are physically adjacent in the table; for each block range, some summary info is stored by the index ex: a table storing a ZIP code column might have all codes for a city grouped together naturally.</description>

      <description>distracting yourself by listening to car radio I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire Exhale desire I know it&amp;#39;s dire My time today I have these thoughts So often I ought To replace that slot With what I once bought &amp;#39;Cause somebody stole My car radio And now I just sit in silence he distracted himself by listening to his car radio, but someone stole it we distract ourselves from our meaningless by clinging to some idea, some person, some materialistic thing some became nihilist, some became hedonist, some became slave, some accept religion dealing with existential crisis Sometimes quiet is violent I find it hard to hide it My pride is no longer inside It&amp;#39;s on my sleeve My skin will scream Reminding me of Who I killed inside my dream I hate this car that I&amp;#39;m driving There&amp;#39;s no hiding for me I&amp;#39;m forced to deal with what I feel There is no distraction to mask what is real I could pull the steering wheel he got to know that his pride is not inside him but in how he is perceived by others he now know that he had killed himself in his dreams, just to fit in and now their is no car radio to distract him from this guilt he is fed up to the point that he even thought of killing himself (pulling the steering wheel) it is a frightening thought I ponder of something terrifying &amp;#39;Cause this time there&amp;#39;s no sound to hide behind I find over the course of our human existence One thing consists of consistence And it&amp;#39;s that we&amp;#39;re all battling fear Oh dear, I don&amp;#39;t know if we know why we&amp;#39;re here Oh my, Too deep Please stop thinking I liked it better when my car had sound this feeling, this thought is so frightening for him and he can&amp;rsquo;t suppress these only thing that is consistent in everybody&amp;rsquo;s life is that they are constantly battling with their suffering and fear He wants to stop thinking about this, and just be normal but ironically, normal is defined by others, and if you dont fit in their template of normal then you are not accepted as normal He wants to be normal and live in a delusional reality, or does he !</description>

      <description>Nihilism I know that there is no objective meaning outside the illusions we (humans) as a society created. Existentialism As humans, we have freedom to create our own meaning to live. Essence make something what it is a defined purpose a meaning to life an essence, necessary for anything to exist Absurdism Constant tension between the hunger for meaning and impossibility of satisfying this drive in a meaningless world. Stare in this meaninglessness and show middle finger.</description>
