<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it&#39;s dire
My time today
I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
&#39;Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence
</code></pre><ul>
<li>he distracted himself by listening to his car radio, but someone
stole it</li>
<li>we distract ourselves from our meaningless by clinging to some idea,
some person, some materialistic thing</li>
<li>some became nihilist, some became hedonist, some became slave, some accept religion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-existential-crisis">dealing with existential crisis</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It&#39;s on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of
Who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I&#39;m driving
There&#39;s no hiding for me
I&#39;m forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel
</code></pre><ul>
<li>he got to know that his pride is not inside him but in how he is
perceived by others</li>
<li>he now know that he had killed himself in his dreams, just to fit in
and now their is no car radio to distract him from this guilt</li>
<li>he is fed up to the point that he even thought of killing himself (pulling the
steering wheel)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="it-is-a-frightening-thought">it is a frightening thought</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">I ponder of something terrifying
&#39;Cause this time there&#39;s no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it&#39;s that we&#39;re all battling fear
Oh dear, I don&#39;t know if we know why we&#39;re here
Oh my,
Too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
</code></pre><ul>
<li>this feeling, this thought is so frightening for him and he can&rsquo;t
suppress these</li>
<li>only thing that is consistent in everybody&rsquo;s life is that they are
constantly battling with their suffering and fear</li>
<li>He wants to stop thinking about this, and just be <em>normal</em></li>
<li>but ironically, normal is defined by others, and if you dont fit in
their template of normal then you are not accepted as normal</li>
<li>He wants to be <em>normal</em> and live in a delusional reality, or does he !</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-it">dealing with it</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-_" data-lang="_">There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win
And fear will lose
There&#39;s faith and there&#39;s sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think
</code></pre><ul>
<li>now that you know that life has no meaning, you just accept it</li>
<li>enjoy it or you become delusional just like the majority of people</li>
<li>to have faith is to be awake and think (<code>I think therefore I am</code> -
<em>Rene Descartes</em>, a cliche quote ik)</li>
<li>the only thing that separates alive and dead is their conciousness,
their ability to think</li>
<li>he is dying to let others know about what he just discovered, and
force them to think, as it liberated him</li>
</ul>
