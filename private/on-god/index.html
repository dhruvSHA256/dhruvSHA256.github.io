Uncertainity</h2><ul><li>nothing is certain in this world and everything is random<li>from the place of your birth to the friends and presence of your loved ones in your life,<li>well everything is not reandom but pseudorandom as their is always a reason for something to happen but we are too lazy to find that reason and praise or blame god for that<li>for example, I got late for college and then took the bench I took, which let me interact with the friends we now have, dictating my life<li>things can go to completely different direction, if I just took a day off of college that day, of arrive early and choose to sit on a different bench, or simply not talk to them or they dont talk to me.<li>hence no matter how hard you try, their is a presence of pseudorandomness dictating the course of your life</ul><h2 id=what-is-god>What is god</h2><ul><li>a image of a creator who created the world, and now controls it<li>people believe that when we worship god he/she may grant our wish and when we do bad stuff god will punish us<li>it is a coping mechanism to deal with hardship and meaninglessness of life, I mean life will get a lot easire when you thing God will stop this suffering in your life and is just testing you<li>god is man made according to me,</ul><h2 id=why-we-created-religion-and-god>Why we created religion and God</h2><ul><li>life is meaningless , we born to die, and we as a species are afraid of our death and also uncertainity of something<li>humans have developed prefrontal cortex unlike our ancestors, and also humans have religion<li>religion is created to provide a framework to live your life, when we are not that developed as a society,<li>religion help us not think about our death and console us about the after life we will get,<li>religion also make us believe that the people we actually care are not dead, they are in a better place and we will meet them when we die, this is plain bullshit<li>it easier for peopel to not kill other people in fear of spending their afterlife in hell than to understand concept like morality<li>morality can exist without god, as morality is just our instinct of altruism which we get after we evolved<li>The presence of God acts like the carrot and the stick for human beings, making them exist in a complex society with other people</ul><h2 id=how-is-religion-started>How is religion started</h2><ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/iqBh7G4uDR8?t=1627" rel=noopener target=_blank>Diana Walsh Pasulka: Aliens, Technology, Religion & the Nature of Belief | Lex Fridman Podcast #149 - YouTube</a><li>religion is not a myth, but god is<li>people have some experiences, they label them as religions or mystic experiences<li>they talk about it to other people, and influence them, and something gets written about it<li>people become affected by it, and when too many people are affected by it, a institution steps in and tries to control the narrative<li>that institution wants power and control over others<li>also in hinduism, every god is a representation of human with fixed set of characters, shows god is created by humans</ul><h2 id=why-we-need-god>Why we need God</h2><ul><li>god is a multipurpos tools<li>we pray to god to grant our wishes <ul><li>but we know that this wont work so we actually work to fullfill our wishes, and those who dont work simply blame god</ul><li>we pray to god before doing something important <ul><li>it acts as positive reinforcement, like when I have my dad looking over me in a competition, I will perform well, or when I write exam with my <em>lucky</em> pen I will score good,<li>these are just manmade believes</ul><li>we thank god for something good happening in our life <ul><li>we cat completely get to know that why some good thing happened in our life, but we are greateful to that so we wanted to thank someone for this<li>we cant thank some person who is not responsible for this so we thank God</ul><li>we ask god why is something bad happened in our life <ul><li>we think we dont deserve suffering in life as we pray to god<li>the things you get in life depends on not only you but several other factors, like your environment, your <em>luck</em> etc<li>and when things doesnt turn out well, we instead of finding the real reason, blame god<li>but some people think that this is just God taking their test, that is just bullshit, they are just consoling themselves that this will be over soon, but they know that their will be no ending to this suffering when they dont do something to change it themselves</ul></ul><h2 id=how-humans-greed-of-power-corrupted-religion>How Humansâ€™ greed of power corrupted religion</h2><ul><li>the desire of power and social status is inherited into us<li>human greed for power made something so beautiful like religion, a shit<li>like if their are 2 bhramans in a village, they have the necessary knowledge<li>they can spread this knowledge to make a whole village of bhramans but they choose not to do so as increase in number of bhramans decreases their demand<li>in some religions we have to follow some rituals to be the part of that religion, that is just like the proof of work in bitcoin that we have to show to get validated to mine block in the block chain<li>however some rituals may be good for us<li>religion does not evolves, and so does rituals, like it is easier to sacrifise a bull, in old times but now its just not practical, same goes with wasting milk over lord shiva, but when someone tries to change that and to evolve the religion, they become the target of peoples hatred</ul><h2 id=religion-and-afterlife>Religion and Afterlife</h2><ul><li>religion allow the smooth functioning of a society<li>and the thought of afterlife allow us to do good deeds to other as a desire to get a place in heaven which is just selfish<li>not everyone wants to be in heaven but everyone wants to get out of hell, this scaring is enough for people to make them incline towards god<li>people can be good to each other without the thought of afterlife also</ul><h2 id=whats-my-interpretation-of-god>Whats my interpretation of god</h2><ul><li>god is representation of randomness<li>I am greatefull to the randomness that the value of G came out to be 9.80665, perfect for life form to exist on this earth<li>and I also know that their is a reason to this which I simply dont know<li>most people confuses this as the creation of god but we know that the presence of god is simply not proven yet<li>so instead of praying to a fictional character, I will choose to be mindfull about the presence of the randomness<li>this allow me to detach from the heavy baggage of rituals and other illogical believes which come with religion</ul><h2 id=i-dont-have-to-believe-in-good>I dont have to believe in good</h2><ul><li>Live a good life,<li>if their gods <ul><li>if they are just <ul><li>they will welcome you based on virtues you have lived by</ul><li>if gods are unjust <ul><li>dont worship them</ul></ul><li>if their are no gods <ul><li>you will be gone but lived a noble life</ul></ul><p
